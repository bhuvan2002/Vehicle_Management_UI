Vehicle_Management_UI
React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a Role-Based Vehicle Management Dashboard built using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Material UI.
It provides two dashboards — Admin and User — along with pages to manage Users and Vehicles.

The UI consumes a backend RBAC API where Admins can manage users/vehicles and assign vehicles, while Users can view their own profile and assigned vehicles.
